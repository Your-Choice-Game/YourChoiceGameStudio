                <p class="mb-4">Notwithstanding any damages that You might incur, the entire liability of the Company and any of its suppliers under any provision of these Terms and Your exclusive remedy for all of the foregoing shall be limited to the amount actually paid by You through In-App Purchases in the Games or INR 1000 if You haven't purchased anything through the Games, as per Section 73 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872.</p>

                <p class="mb-4">Some jurisdictions, including under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages, so some of the above limitations may not apply. In these cases, each party's liability will be limited to the greatest extent permitted by law, provided such limitations are not deemed unconscionable under Section 23 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872.</p>
